# Linux Blind Files

In some cases during exploitation you as an attacker gain the ability to read arbitrary files. As an attacker you need go-to files that cover as many different OS versions as possible in order to either confirm exploitation or gather intelligence on the exploited system. For this we use a "blind file".

The files below are things to pull when all you can do is to blindly read. Examples of vulnerabilities or situations where this would be helpful might be: local file includes (LFI), directory traversals or remote file share instances like SMB, FTP, NFS or otherwise.

## Examples

### passwd
* **Files**: /etc/passwd
* **Description**: List of account names, groups, home directory, and shell (should be globally readable).

### shadow
* **Files**: /etc/shadow
* **Description**: List of all user's password hashes (requires root). 

### resolv.conf
* **File**: /etc/resolv.conf 
* **Description**: Contains the current name servers (DNS) for the system. This is a globally readable file that is less likely to trigger IDS alerts than /etc/passwd.

### motd
* **File**: /etc/motd
* **Description**: Message of the Day.

### issue
* **File**: /etc/issue
* **Description**: A message or system identification to be printed before the login prompt.

### .bash_history
* **File**: /home/xxx/.bash_history
* **Description**: Shell history for user 'xxx' (requires valid user).

### version
* **File**: /proc/version
* **Description**: Linux kernel version information.
