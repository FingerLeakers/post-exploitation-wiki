#### Known issue with Chrome:

Chrome doesn't allow local file access from local files loaded in the
browser (ala index.html loading index.md). There are two ways around this. Use a web server to host
it (Apache, nginx, python SimpleHTTPServer, etc) or start Chrome with the `--allow-file-access-from-files`
argument. See here for more details: http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!faq.md
